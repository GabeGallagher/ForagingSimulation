- It's weird that normal mathematical convention considers the primary axis to be the x-axis, while robotics thinks in terms of directions (north, east, south, west) so the primary axis becomes the y-axis. This makes sense, because robotics deals with bodies that move through the world, so they need a relative perspective which will always consider forward to be the primary point of referece. Math, I supposes, is fundamentally read left to right, therefore it makes sense that the x-axis would be the primary. I've never thought about fundamental orientation in this way before, but it keeps coming up when using robotics because many of the math libraries write coordinates in x, y, while in robotics it's flipped to y, x. I'll have to keep track of this in my head and I forsee some stupid bugs arising from this. I wonder if there are other aspects of robotics that are at odds with mathematics in this way. If so, I wonder if there are libraries that handle these issues, or if it would be worth it to write my own.
- I'm bad at the mathematics of orientations. Might need to review some trig
- How do we handle movement? I was thinking that this would actually be a pretty trivial part of the simulation, but I ran into an interesting question. volicity is measured as direction * movement along the x/y axes over time. However, where does that over time come from? Is the nest aware of the time, and constantly send signals to the bots to move at a given time step? Should the bots be aware of the time and their movement speed? The solution I came up with is to use a similar solution to what I've worked with in game engines and use an update loop that's tightly coupled with real time, but allows different object to only use time and time changes as needed. The nest likely needs to know what time it is for more advanced procedures, but separating the time from the brain forces the constraint of the brain working within time constraints, rather than giving the ability to manipulate time for more effecient solutions. Of course, the bots don't need to be aware of time, just that they are moving at a given speed.
Feels like the most difficult part of this so far has been writing the world time and animation code. Makes me think using an engine like unity or godot would be better for the simulation, while maintaining code to run headless
Another issue is keeping track of what different objects are in python, since it is not a strongly typed language. I only forsee this becoming more of an issue as this project gets bigger. Wonder what way there are to help mitigate this.
Also, is VS code, imports are kind of annoying. I'm wondering if there are vs code packages for python that make it easier to infer imports like what pycharm does
